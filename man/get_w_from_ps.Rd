\title{Compute weights from propensity scores}
\usage{
get_w_from_ps(
  ps,
  treat,
  estimand = "ATE",
  focal = NULL,
  treated = NULL,
  subclass = NULL,
  stabilize = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ps}{a vector, matrix, or data frame of propensity scores. See Details.}

\item{treat}{a vector of treatment status for each individual. See Details.}

\item{estimand}{the desired estimand that the weights should target. Current
options include \code{"ATE"} (average treatment effect), \code{"ATT"} (average treatment
effect on the treated), \code{"ATC"} (average treatment effect on the control),
\code{"ATO"} (average treatment effect in the overlap), \code{"ATM"} (average treatment
effect in the matched sample), and \code{"ATOS"} (average treatment effect in the
optimal subset). See Details.}

\item{focal}{when \code{estimand} is \code{"ATT"} or \code{"ATC"}, which group should be
consider the (focal) "treated" or "control" group, respectively. If not
\code{NULL} and \code{estimand} is not \code{"ATT"} or \code{"ATC"}, \code{estimand} will
automatically be set to \code{"ATT"}.}

\item{treated}{when treatment is binary, the value of \code{treat} that is
considered the "treated" group (i.e., the group for which the propensity
scores are the probability of being in). If \code{NULL},
\code{get_w_from_ps()} will attempt to figure it out on its own using some
heuristics. This really only matters when \code{treat} has values other than
0 and 1 and when \code{ps} is given as a vector or an unnamed single-column
matrix or data frame.}

\item{subclass}{\code{numeric}; the number of subclasses to use when
computing weights using marginal mean weighting through stratification (also
known as fine stratification). If \code{NULL}, standard inverse probability
weights (and their extensions) will be computed; if a number greater than 1,
subclasses will be formed and weights will be computed based on subclass
membership. \code{estimand} must be \code{"ATE"}, \code{"ATT"}, or \code{"ATC"} if \code{subclass} is
non-\code{NULL}. See Details.}

\item{stabilize}{\code{logical}; whether to compute stabilized weights or
not. This simply involves multiplying each unit's weight by the proportion
of units in their treatment group. For saturated outcome models and in
balance checking, this won't make a difference; otherwise, this can improve
performance.}
}
\value{
A vector of weights. When \code{subclass} is not \code{NULL}, the
subclasses are returned as the \code{"subclass"} attribute. When
\code{estimand = "ATOS"}, the chosen value of \code{alpha} (the smallest
propensity score allowed to remain in the sample) is returned in the
\code{"alpha"} attribute.
}
\description{
Given a vector or matrix of propensity scores, outputs a vector of weights
that target the provided estimand.
}
\details{
\code{get_w_from_ps()} applies the formula for computing weights from
propensity scores for the desired estimand. The formula for each estimand is below, with \eqn{A_i} the treatment value for unit \eqn{i} taking on values \eqn{\mathcal{A} = (1, \ldots, g)}, \eqn{p_{a, i}} the probability of receiving treatment level \eqn{a} for unit \eqn{i}, and \eqn{f} is the focal group (the treated group for the ATT and the control group for the ATC):

\deqn{
\begin{aligned}
w^{ATE}_i &= 1 / p_{A_i, i} \\
w^{ATT}_i &= w^{ATE}_i \times p_{f, i} \\
w^{ATO}_i &= w^{ATE}_i / \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}}{1/p_{a, i}} \\
w^{ATM}_i &= w^{ATE}_i \times \min(p_{1, i}, \ldots, p_{g, i}) \\
w^{ATOS}_i &= w^{ATE}_i \times \mathbb{1}\left(\alpha < p_{2, i} < 1 - \alpha\right)
\end{aligned}
}

\code{get_w_from_ps()} can only be used with binary and multi-category treatments.
\subsection{Supplying the \code{ps} argument}{

The \code{ps} argument can be entered in two ways:
\itemize{
\item A numeric matrix with a row for each unit and a (named) column for each treatment level, with each cell corresponding to the probability of receiving the corresponding treatment level
\item A numeric vector with a value for each unit corresponding to the probability of being "treated" (only allowed for binary treatments)
}

When supplied as a vector, \code{get_w_from_ps()} has to know which value of \code{treat}
corresponds to the "treated" group. For 0/1 variables, 1 will be considered
treated. For other types of variables, \code{get_w_from_ps()} will try to
figure it out using heuristics, but it's safer to supply an argument to
\code{treated}. When \code{estimand} is \code{"ATT"} or \code{"ATC"}, supplying a value to
\code{focal} is sufficient (for ATT, \code{focal} is the treated group, and
for ATC, \code{focal} is the control group).

When supplied as a matrix, the columns must be named with the levels of the treatment, and
it is assumed that each column corresponds to the probability of being in
that treatment group. This is the safest way to supply \code{ps} unless
\code{treat} is a 0/1 variable. When \code{estimand} is \code{"ATT"} or \code{"ATC"}, a value for \code{focal}
must be specified.
}

\subsection{Marginal mean weighting through stratification (MMWS)}{

When \code{subclass} is not \code{NULL}, MMWS weights are computed. The implementation differs
slightly from that described in Hong (2010, 2012). First, subclasses are
formed by finding the quantiles of the propensity scores in the target group
(for the ATE, all units; for the ATT or ATC, just the units in the focal
group). Any subclasses lacking members of a treatment group will be filled
in with them from neighboring subclasses so each subclass will always have
at least one member of each treatment group. A new subclass-propensity score
matrix is formed, where each unit's subclass-propensity score for each
treatment value is computed as the proportion of units with that treatment
value in the unit's subclass. For example, if a subclass had 10 treated
units and 90 control units in it, the subclass-propensity score for being
treated would be .1 and the subclass-propensity score for being control
would be .9 for all units in the subclass.

For multi-category treatments,
the propensity scores for each treatment are stratified separately as
described in Hong (2012); for binary treatments, only one set of propensity
scores are stratified and the subclass-propensity scores for the other
treatment are computed as the complement of the propensity scores for the
stratified treatment.

After the subclass-propensity scores have been
computed, the standard propensity score weighting formulas are used to
compute the unstabilized MMWS weights. To estimate MMWS weights equivalent
to those described in Hong (2010, 2012), \code{stabilize} must be set to
\code{TRUE}, but, as with standard propensity score weights, this is
optional. Note that MMWS weights are also known as fine stratification
weights and described by Desai et al. (2017).
