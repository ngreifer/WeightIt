\title{Compute weights from propensity scores}
\usage{
get_w_from_ps(
  ps,
  treat,
  estimand = "ATE",
  focal = NULL,
  treated = NULL,
  subclass = NULL,
  stabilize = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ps}{a vector, matrix, or data frame of propensity scores. See Details.}

\item{treat}{a vector of treatment status for each individual. See Details.}

\item{estimand}{the desired estimand that the weights should target. Current
options include \code{"ATE"} (average treatment effect), \code{"ATT"} (average
treatment effect on the treated), \code{"ATC"} (average treatment effect on the
control), \code{"ATO"} (average treatment effect in the overlap), \code{"ATM"}
(average treatment effect in the matched sample), and \code{"ATOS"} (average
treatment effect in the optimal subset). See Details.}

\item{focal}{when \code{estimand} is \code{"ATT"} or \code{"ATC"}, which group should be
consider the (focal) "treated" or "control" group, respectively. If not
\code{NULL} and \code{estimand} is not \code{"ATT"} or \code{"ATC"}, \code{estimand} will
automatically be set to \code{"ATT"}.}

\item{treated}{when treatment is binary, the value of \code{treat} that is
considered the "treated" group (i.e., the group for which the propensity
scores are the probability of being in). If \code{NULL}, \code{get_w_from_ps()} will
attempt to figure it out on its own using some heuristics. This really only
matters when \code{treat} has values other than 0 and 1 and when \code{ps} is given
as a vector or an unnamed single-column matrix or data frame.}

\item{subclass}{\code{numeric}; the number of subclasses to use when computing
weights using marginal mean weighting through stratification (MMWS; also known as
fine stratification). If \code{NULL}, standard inverse probability weights (and
their extensions) will be computed; if a number greater than 1, subclasses
will be formed and weights will be computed based on subclass membership.
\code{estimand} must be \code{"ATE"}, \code{"ATT"}, or \code{"ATC"} if \code{subclass} is
non-\code{NULL}. See Details.}

\item{stabilize}{\code{logical}; whether to compute stabilized weights or not.
This simply involves multiplying each unit's weight by the proportion of
units in their treatment group. For saturated outcome models and in balance
checking, this won't make a difference; otherwise, this can improve
performance.}
}
\value{
A vector of weights. When \code{subclass} is not \code{NULL}, the subclasses
are returned as the \code{"subclass"} attribute. When \code{estimand = "ATOS"}, the
chosen value of \code{alpha} (the smallest propensity score allowed to remain in
the sample) is returned in the \code{"alpha"} attribute.
}
\description{
Given a vector or matrix of propensity scores, outputs a vector
of weights that target the provided estimand.
}
\details{
\code{get_w_from_ps()} applies the formula for computing weights from
propensity scores for the desired estimand. The formula for each estimand is
below, with \eqn{A_i} the treatment value for unit \eqn{i} taking on values
\eqn{\mathcal{A} = (1, \ldots, g)}, \eqn{p_{a, i}} the probability of
receiving treatment level \eqn{a} for unit \eqn{i}, and \eqn{f} is the focal
group (the treated group for the ATT and the control group for the ATC):

\deqn{
\begin{aligned}
w^{ATE}_i &= 1 / p_{A_i, i} \\
w^{ATT}_i &= w^{ATE}_i \times p_{f, i} \\
w^{ATO}_i &= w^{ATE}_i / \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}}{1/p_{a, i}} \\
w^{ATM}_i &= w^{ATE}_i \times \min(p_{1, i}, \ldots, p_{g, i}) \\
w^{ATOS}_i &= w^{ATE}_i \times \mathbb{1}\left(\alpha < p_{2, i} < 1 - \alpha\right)
\end{aligned}
}

\code{get_w_from_ps()} can only be used with binary and multi-category treatments.
\subsection{Supplying the \code{ps} argument}{

The \code{ps} argument can be entered in two ways:
\itemize{
\item A numeric matrix with a row for each unit and a (named) column for each treatment level, with each cell corresponding to the probability of receiving the corresponding treatment level
\item A numeric vector with a value for each unit corresponding to the probability of being "treated" (only allowed for binary treatments)
}

When supplied as a vector, \code{get_w_from_ps()} has to know which value of
\code{treat} corresponds to the "treated" group. For 0/1 variables, 1 will be
considered treated. For other types of variables, \code{get_w_from_ps()} will try
to figure it out using heuristics, but it's safer to supply an argument to
\code{treated}. When \code{estimand} is \code{"ATT"} or \code{"ATC"}, supplying a value to
\code{focal} is sufficient (for ATT, \code{focal} is the treated group, and for ATC,
\code{focal} is the control group).

When supplied as a matrix, the columns must be named with the levels of the
treatment, and it is assumed that each column corresponds to the probability
of being in that treatment group. This is the safest way to supply \code{ps}
unless \code{treat} is a 0/1 variable. When \code{estimand} is \code{"ATT"} or \code{"ATC"}, a
value for \code{focal} must be specified.
}

\subsection{Marginal mean weighting through stratification (MMWS)}{

When \code{subclass} is not \code{NULL}, MMWS weights are computed. The implementation
differs slightly from that described in Hong (2010, 2012). First, subclasses
are formed by finding the quantiles of the propensity scores in the target
group (for the ATE, all units; for the ATT or ATC, just the units in the
focal group). Any subclasses lacking members of a treatment group will be
filled in with them from neighboring subclasses so each subclass will always
have at least one member of each treatment group. A new subclass-propensity
score matrix is formed, where each unit's subclass-propensity score for each
treatment value is computed as the proportion of units with that treatment
value in the unit's subclass. For example, if a subclass had 10 treated units
and 90 control units in it, the subclass-propensity score for being treated
would be .1 and the subclass-propensity score for being control would be .9
for all units in the subclass.

For multi-category treatments, the propensity scores for each treatment are
stratified separately as described in Hong (2012); for binary treatments,
only one set of propensity scores are stratified and the subclass-propensity
scores for the other treatment are computed as the complement of the
propensity scores for the stratified treatment.

After the subclass-propensity scores have been computed, the standard
propensity score weighting formulas are used to compute the unstabilized MMWS
weights. To estimate MMWS weights equivalent to those described in Hong
(2010, 2012), \code{stabilize} must be set to \code{TRUE}, but, as with standard
propensity score weights, this is optional. Note that MMWS weights are also
known as fine stratification weights and described by Desai et al. (2017).
