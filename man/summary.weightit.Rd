\usage{
\method{summary}{weightit}(object, top = 5L, ignore.s.weights = FALSE, weight.range = TRUE, ...)

\method{plot}{summary.weightit}(x, binwidth = NULL, bins = NULL, ...)

\method{summary}{weightitMSM}(object, top = 5L, ignore.s.weights = FALSE, weight.range = TRUE, ...)

\method{plot}{summary.weightitMSM}(x, binwidth = NULL, bins = NULL, time = 1L, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a \code{weightit} or \code{weightitMSM} object; the output of a call to
\code{\link[=weightit]{weightit()}} or \code{\link[=weightitMSM]{weightitMSM()}}.}

\item{top}{how many of the largest and smallest weights to display. Default
is 5. Ignored when \code{weight.range = FALSE}.}

\item{ignore.s.weights}{\code{logical}; whether or not to ignore sampling weights when
computing the weight summary. If \code{FALSE}, the default, the estimated
weights will be multiplied by the sampling weights (if any) before values
are computed.}

\item{weight.range}{\code{logical}; whether to display statistics about the range of weights and the highest and lowest weights for each group. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{For \code{plot()}, additional arguments passed to \code{\link[graphics:hist]{graphics::hist()}} to
determine the number of bins, though \code{\link[ggplot2:geom_histogram]{ggplot2::geom_histogram()}} is
actually used to create the plot.}

\item{x}{a \code{summary.weightit} or \code{summary.weightitMSM} object; the output of
a call to \code{summary.weightit()} or \code{summary.weightitMSM()}.}

\item{binwidth, bins}{arguments passed to \code{\link[ggplot2:geom_histogram]{ggplot2::geom_histogram()}} to
control the size and/or number of bins.}

\item{time}{\code{numeric}; the time point for which to display the distribution
of weights. Default is to plot the distribution for the first time points.}
}
\value{
For point treatments (i.e., \code{weightit} objects), \code{summary()} returns
a \code{summary.weightit} object with the following elements:

\item{weight.range}{The range (minimum and maximum) weight for each treatment group.}
\item{weight.top}{The units with the greatest weights in each treatment group; how many are included is determined by \code{top}.}
\item{coef.of.var (Coef of Var)}{The coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by mean) of the weights in each treatment group and overall.}
\item{scaled.mad (MAD)}{The mean absolute deviation of the weights in each treatment group and overall divided by the mean of the weights in the corresponding group.}
\item{negative entropy (Entropy)}{The negative entropy (\eqn{\sum w log(w)}) of the weights in each treatment group and overall divided by the mean of the weights in the corresponding group.}
\item{num.zeros}{The number of weights equal to zero.}
\item{effective.sample.size}{The effective sample size for each treatment group before and after weighting. See \code{\link[=ESS]{ESS()}}.}

For longitudinal treatments (i.e., \code{weightitMSM} objects), \code{summary()}
returns a list of the above elements for each treatment period.

\code{plot()} returns a \code{ggplot} object with a histogram displaying the
distribution of the estimated weights. If the estimand is the ATT or ATC,
only the weights for the non-focal group(s) will be displayed (since the
weights for the focal group are all 1). A dotted line is displayed at the
mean of the weights.

\code{nobs()} returns a single number. Note that even units with \code{weights} or
\code{s.weights} of 0 are included.
}
\description{
\code{summary()} generates a summary of the \code{weightit} or
\code{weightitMSM} object to evaluate the properties of the estimated weights.
\code{plot()} plots the distribution of the weights. \code{nobs()} extracts the number
of observations.
