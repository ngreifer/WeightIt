\arguments{
\item{formula}{a formula with a treatment variable on the left hand side and
the covariates to be balanced on the right hand side. See \code{\link[=glm]{glm()}} for more
details. Interactions and functions of covariates are allowed.}

\item{data}{an optional data set in the form of a data frame that contains
the variables in \code{formula}.}

\item{method}{a string of length 1 containing the name of the method that
will be used to estimate weights. See Details below for allowable options.
The default is \code{"glm"} for propensity score weighting using a
generalized linear model to estimate the propensity score.}

\item{estimand}{the desired estimand. For binary and multi-category
treatments, can be \code{"ATE"}, \code{"ATT"}, \code{"ATC"}, and, for some
methods, \code{"ATO"}, \code{"ATM"}, or \code{"ATOS"}. The default for both
is \code{"ATE"}. This argument is ignored for continuous treatments. See the
individual pages for each method for more information on which estimands are
allowed with each method and what literature to read to interpret these
estimands.}

\item{stabilize}{whether or not and how to stabilize the weights. If \code{TRUE}, each unit's weight will be multiplied by a standardization factor, which is the inverse of the unconditional probability (or density) of each unit's observed treatment value. If a formula, a generalized linear model will be fit with the included predictors, and the inverse of the corresponding weight will be used as the standardization factor. Can only be used with continuous treatments or when \code{estimand = "ATE"}. Default is \code{FALSE} for no standardization. See also the \code{num.formula} argument at \code{\link[=weightitMSM]{weightitMSM()}}}

\item{focal}{when multi-category treatments are used and ATT weights are
requested, which group to consider the "treated" or focal group. This group
will not be weighted, and the other groups will be weighted to be more like
the focal group. If specified, \code{estimand} will automatically be set to
\code{"ATT"}.}

\item{by}{a string containing the name of the variable in \code{data} for
which weighting is to be done within categories or a one-sided formula with
the stratifying variable on the right-hand side. For example, if \code{by = "gender"} or \code{by = ~gender}, a separate propensity score model or optimization will occur within each level of the variable \code{"gender"}. Only one
\code{by} variable is allowed; to stratify by multiply variables
simultaneously, create a new variable that is a full cross of those
variables using \code{\link[=interaction]{interaction()}}.}

\item{s.weights}{A vector of sampling weights or the name of a variable in
\code{data} that contains sampling weights. These can also be matching
weights if weighting is to be used on matched data. See the individual pages
for each method for information on whether sampling weights can be supplied.}

\item{ps}{A vector of propensity scores or the name of a variable in
\code{data} containing propensity scores. If not \code{NULL}, \code{method}
is ignored unless it is a user-supplied function, and the propensity scores will be used to create weights.
\code{formula} must include the treatment variable in \code{data}, but the
listed covariates will play no role in the weight estimation. Using
\code{ps} is similar to calling \code{\link[=get_w_from_ps]{get_w_from_ps()}} directly, but produces a
full \code{weightit} object rather than just producing weights.}

\item{moments}{\code{numeric}; for some methods, the greatest power of each
covariate to be balanced. For example, if \code{moments = 3}, for each
non-categorical covariate, the covariate, its square, and its cube will be
balanced. This argument is ignored for other methods; to balance powers of
the covariates, appropriate functions must be entered in \code{formula}. See
the individual pages for each method for information on whether they accept
\code{moments}.}

\item{int}{\code{logical}; for some methods, whether first-order
interactions of the covariates are to be balanced. This argument is ignored
for other methods; to balance interactions between the variables,
appropriate functions must be entered in \code{formula}. See the individual
pages for each method for information on whether they accept \code{int}.}

\item{subclass}{\code{numeric}; the number of subclasses to use for
computing weights using marginal mean weighting with subclasses (MMWS). If
\code{NULL}, standard inverse probability weights (and their extensions)
will be computed; if a number greater than 1, subclasses will be formed and
weights will be computed based on subclass membership. Attempting to set a
non-\code{NULL} value for methods that don't compute a propensity score will
result in an error; see each method's help page for information on whether
MMWS weights are compatible with the method. See \code{\link[=get_w_from_ps]{get_w_from_ps()}} for
details and references.}

\item{missing}{\code{character}; how missing data should be handled. The
options and defaults depend on the \code{method} used. Ignored if no missing
data is present. It should be noted that multiple imputation outperforms all
available missingness methods available in \code{weightit()} and should
probably be used instead. Consider the \CRANpkg{MatchThem}
package for the use of \code{weightit()} with multiply imputed data.}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical}; whether to print additional information
output by the fitting function.}

\item{include.obj}{\code{logical}; whether to include in the output any fit
objects created in the process of estimating the weights. For example, with
\code{method = "glm"}, the \code{glm} objects containing the propensity
score model will be included. See the individual pages for each method for
information on what object will be included if \code{TRUE}.}

\item{keep.mparts}{\code{logical}; whether to include in the output components necessary to estimate standard errors that account for estimation of the weights in \code{\link[=glm_weightit]{glm_weightit()}}. Default is \code{TRUE} if such parts are present. See the individual pages for each method for whether these components are produced. Set to \code{FALSE} to keep the output object smaller, e.g., if standard errors will not be computed using \code{glm_weightit()}.}

\item{...}{other arguments for functions called by \code{weightit()} that
control aspects of fitting that are not covered by the above arguments. See Details.}
}
\value{
A \code{weightit} object with the following elements:
\item{weights}{The estimated weights, one for each unit.}
\item{treat}{The values of the treatment variable.}
\item{covs}{The covariates used in the fitting. Only includes the raw covariates, which may have been altered in
the fitting process.}
\item{estimand}{The estimand requested.}
\item{method}{The weight estimation method specified.}
\item{ps}{The estimated or provided propensity scores. Estimated propensity scores are
returned for binary treatments and only when \code{method} is \code{"glm"}, \code{"gbm"}, \code{"cbps"}, \code{"ipt"}, \code{"super"}, or \code{"bart"}.}
\item{s.weights}{The provided sampling weights.}
\item{focal}{The focal treatment level if the ATT or ATC was requested.}
\item{by}{A data.frame containing the \code{by} variable when specified.}
\item{obj}{When \code{include.obj = TRUE}, the fit object.}
\item{info}{Additional information about the fitting. See the individual
methods pages for what is included.}

When \code{keep.mparts} is \code{TRUE} (the default) and the chosen method is compatible with M-estimation, the components related to M-estimation for use in \code{\link[=glm_weightit]{glm_weightit()}} are stored in the \code{"Mparts"} attribute. When \code{by} is specified, \code{keep.mparts} is set to \code{FALSE}.

\description{
\code{weightit()} allows for the easy generation of balancing weights using
a variety of available methods for binary, continuous, and multi-category
treatments. Many of these methods exist in other packages, which
\code{weightit()} calls; these packages must be installed to use the desired
method.
}
\details{
The primary purpose of \code{weightit()} is as a dispatcher to functions
that perform the estimation of balancing weights using the requested
\code{method}. Below are the methods allowed and links to pages containing
more information about them, including additional arguments and outputs
(e.g., when \code{include.obj = TRUE}), how missing values are treated,
which estimands are allowed, and whether sampling weights are allowed.\tabular{ll}{
