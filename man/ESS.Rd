\title{
Compute effective sample size of weighted sample
}
\description{
Computes the effective sample size (ESS) of a weighted sample, which represents the size of an unweighted sample with approximately the same amount of precision as the weighted sample under consideration.}
\usage{
ESS(w)
}
\arguments{
  \item{w}{
a vector of weights
}
}
\details{
The ESS is calculated as \code{sum(w)^2/sum(w^2)}.
