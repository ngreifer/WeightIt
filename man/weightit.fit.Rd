}
\arguments{
\item{covs}{a numeric matrix of covariates.}

\item{treat}{a vector of treatment statuses.}

\item{method}{a string of length 1 containing the name of the method that
will be used to estimate weights. See \code{\link[=weightit]{weightit()}} for allowable options.
The default is \code{"glm"} for propensity score weighting using a
generalized linear model to estimate the propensity score.}

\item{s.weights}{a numeric vector of sampling weights. See the individual
pages for each method for information on whether sampling weights can be
supplied.}

\item{by.factor}{a factor variable for which weighting is to be done within
levels. Corresponds to the \code{by} argument in \code{\link[=weightit]{weightit()}}.}

\item{estimand}{the desired estimand. For binary and multi-category
treatments, can be "ATE", "ATT", "ATC", and, for some methods, "ATO", "ATM",
or "ATOS". The default for both is "ATE". This argument is ignored for
continuous treatments. See the individual pages for each method for more
information on which estimands are allowed with each method and what
literature to read to interpret these estimands.}

\item{focal}{when multi-category treatments are used and ATT weights are
requested, which group to consider the "treated" or focal group. This group
will not be weighted, and the other groups will be weighted to be more like
the focal group. Must be non-\code{NULL} if \code{estimand = "ATT"} or
\code{"ATC"}.}

\item{stabilize}{\code{logical}; whether or not to stabilize the weights.
For the methods that involve estimating propensity scores, this involves
multiplying each unit's weight by the proportion of units in their treatment
group. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{ps}{a vector of propensity scores. If specified, \code{method} will be
ignored and set to \code{"glm"}.}

\item{moments, int, subclass}{arguments to customize the weight estimation.
See \code{\link[=weightit]{weightit()}} for details.}

\item{is.MSM.method}{see \code{\link[=weightitMSM]{weightitMSM()}}. Typically can be ignored.}

\item{missing}{\code{character}; how missing data should be handled. The
options depend on the \code{method} used. If \code{NULL}, \code{covs} covs
will be checked for \code{NA} values, and if present, \code{missing} will be
set to \code{"ind"}. If \code{""}, \code{covs} covs will not be checked for
\code{NA} values; this can be faster when it is known there are none.}

\item{verbose}{whether to print additional information output by the fitting
function.}

\item{include.obj}{whether to include in the output any fit objects created
in the process of estimating the weights. For example, with \code{method = "glm"}, the \code{glm} objects containing the propensity score model will be
included. See the individual pages for each method for information on what
object will be included if \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{other arguments for functions called by \code{weightit.fit()}
that control aspects of fitting that are not covered by the above arguments.}
}
\value{
A \code{weightit.fit} object with the following elements:
\item{weights}{The estimated weights, one for each unit.}
\item{treat}{The values of the treatment variable.}
\item{estimand}{The estimand requested. ATC is recoded as ATT.}
\item{method}{The weight estimation method specified.}
\item{ps}{The estimated or provided propensity scores. Estimated propensity scores are returned for binary treatments and only when \code{method} is \code{"glm"}, \code{"gbm"}, \code{"cbps"}, \code{"super"}, or \code{"bart"}.}
\item{s.weights}{The provided sampling weights.}
\item{focal}{The focal treatment level if the ATT or ATC was requested.}
\item{fit.obj}{When \code{include.obj = TRUE}, the fit object.}
\item{info}{Additional information about the fitting. See the individual methods pages for what is included.}

The \code{weightit.fit} object does not have specialized \code{print()},
\code{summary()}, or \code{plot()} methods. It is simply a list containing
the above components. Use \code{\link[=as.weightit]{as.weightit()}} to convert it to a \code{weightit} object, which does have these methods. See Examples.

\description{
\code{weightit.fit()} dispatches one of the weight estimation methods
determined by \code{method}. It is an internal function called by
\code{\link[=weightit]{weightit()}} and should probably not be used except in special cases. Unlike
\code{weightit()}, \code{weightit.fit()} does not accept a formula and data
frame interface and instead requires the covariates and treatment to be
supplied as a numeric matrix and atomic vector, respectively. In this way,
\code{weightit.fit()} is to \code{weightit()} what \code{\link[=lm.fit]{lm.fit()}} is to \code{\link[=lm]{lm()}} -
a thinner, slightly faster interface that performs minimal argument
checking.
}
\details{
\code{weightit.fit()} is called by \code{\link[=weightit]{weightit()}} after the arguments to
\code{weightit()} have been checked and processed. \code{weightit.fit()}
dispatches the function used to actually estimate the weights, passing on
the supplied arguments directly. \code{weightit.fit()} is not meant to be
used by anyone other than experienced users who have a specific use case in
mind. The returned object contains limited information about the supplied
arguments or details of the estimation method; all that is processed by
\code{weightit()}.

Less argument checking or processing occurs in \code{weightit.fit()} than
does in \code{weightit()}, which means supplying incorrect arguments can
result in errors, crashes, and invalid weights, and error and warning
messages may not be helpful in diagnosing the problem. \code{weightit.fit()}
does check to make sure weights were actually estimated, though.

\code{weightit.fit()} may be most useful in speeding up simulation
simulation studies that use \code{weightit()} because the covariates can be
supplied as a numeric matrix, which is often how they are generated in
simulations, without having to go through the potentially slow process of
extracting the covariates and treatment from a formula and data frame. If
the user is certain the arguments are valid (e.g., by ensuring the estimated
weights are consistent with those estimated from \code{weightit()} with the
same arguments), less time needs to be spent on processing the arguments.
Also, the returned object is much smaller than a \code{weightit} object
because the covariates are not returned alongside the weights.
