\usage{
sbps(
  obj,
  obj2 = NULL,
  moderator = NULL,
  formula = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  smooth = FALSE,
  full.search
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{a \code{weightit} object containing weights estimated in the
overall sample.}

\item{obj2}{a \code{weightit} object containing weights estimated in the
subgroups. Typically this has been estimated by including \code{by} in the
call to \code{\link[=weightit]{weightit()}}. Either \code{obj2} or \code{moderator} must be
specified.}

\item{moderator}{optional; a string containing the name of the variable in
\code{data} for which weighting is to be done within subgroups or a
one-sided formula with the subgrouping variable on the right-hand side. This
argument is analogous to the \code{by} argument in \code{weightit()}, and in
fact it is passed on to \code{by}. Either \code{obj2} or \code{moderator}
must be specified.}

\item{formula}{an optional formula with the covariates for which balance is
to be optimized. If not specified, the formula in \code{obj$call} will be
used.}

\item{data}{an optional data set in the form of a data frame that contains
the variables in \code{formula} or \code{moderator}.}

\item{smooth}{\code{logical}; whether the smooth version of the SBPS should
be used. This is only compatible with \code{weightit} methods that return a
propensity score.}

\item{full.search}{\code{logical}; when \code{smooth = FALSE}, whether every
combination of subgroup and overall weights should be evaluated. If
\code{FALSE}, a stochastic search as described in DZZL will be used instead.
If \code{TRUE}, all \eqn{2^R} combinations will be checked, where \eqn{R} is
the number of subgroups, which can take a long time with many subgroups. If
unspecified, will default to \code{TRUE} if \eqn{R <= 8} and \code{FALSE}
otherwise.}
}
\value{
A \code{weightit.sbps} object, which inherits from \code{weightit}.
This contains all the information in \code{obj} with the weights, propensity
scores, call, and possibly covariates updated from \code{sbps()}. In
addition, the \code{prop.subgroup} component contains the values of the
coefficients C for the subgroups (which are either 0 or 1 for the standard
SBPS), and the \code{moderator} component contains a data.frame with the
moderator.

This object has its own summary method and is compatible with \pkg{cobalt}
functions. The \code{cluster} argument should be used with \pkg{cobalt}
functions to accurately reflect the performance of the weights in balancing
the subgroups.

\description{
Implements the subgroup balancing propensity score (SBPS), which is an
algorithm that attempts to achieve balance in subgroups by sharing
information from the overall sample and subgroups (Dong, Zhang, Zeng, & Li,
2020; DZZL). Each subgroup can use either weights estimated using the whole
sample, weights estimated using just that subgroup, or a combination of the
two. The optimal combination is chosen as that which minimizes an imbalance
criterion that includes subgroup as well as overall balance.
}
\details{
The SBPS relies on two sets of weights: one estimated in the overall sample
and one estimated within each subgroup. The algorithm decides whether each
subgroup should use the weights estimated in the overall sample or those
estimated in the subgroup. There are 2^R permutations of overall and
subgroup weights, where R is the number of subgroups. The optimal
permutation is chosen as that which minimizes a balance criterion as
described in DZZL. The balance criterion used here is, for binary and
multi-category treatments, the sum of the squared standardized mean differences
within subgroups and overall, which are computed using
\code{\link[cobalt:balance-summary]{cobalt::col_w_smd()}}, and for continuous treatments, the
sum of the squared correlations between each covariate and treatment within
subgroups and overall, which are computed using \code{\link[cobalt:balance-summary]{cobalt::col_w_corr()}}.

The smooth version estimates weights that determine the relative
contribution of the overall and subgroup propensity scores to a weighted
average propensity score for each subgroup. If P_O are the propensity scores
estimated in the overall sample and P_S are the propensity scores estimated
in each subgroup, the smooth SBPS finds R coefficients C so that for each
subgroup, the ultimate propensity score is \eqn{C*P_S + (1-C)*P_O}, and
weights are computed from this propensity score. The coefficients are
estimated using \code{\link[=optim]{optim()}} with \code{method = "L-BFGS-B"}. When C is
estimated to be 1 or 0 for each subgroup, the smooth SBPS coincides with the
standard SBPS.

If \code{obj2} is not specified and \code{moderator} is, \code{sbps()} will
attempt to refit the model specified in \code{obj} with the \code{moderator}
in the \code{by} argument. This relies on the environment in which
\code{obj} was created to be intact and can take some time if \code{obj} was
hard to fit. It's safer to estimate \code{obj} and \code{obj2} (the latter
simply by including the moderator in the \code{by} argument) and supply
these to \code{sbps()}.
