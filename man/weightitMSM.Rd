\arguments{
\item{formula.list}{a list of formulas corresponding to each time point with
the time-specific treatment variable on the left hand side and
pre-treatment covariates to be balanced on the right hand side. The
formulas must be in temporal order, and must contain all covariates to be
balanced at that time point (i.e., treatments and covariates featured in
early formulas should appear in later ones). Interactions and functions of
covariates are allowed.}

\item{data}{an optional data set in the form of a data frame that contains
the variables in the formulas in \code{formula.list}. This must be a wide data
set with exactly one row per unit.}

\item{method}{a string of length 1 containing the name of the method that
will be used to estimate weights. See \code{\link[=weightit]{weightit()}} for allowable options.
The default is \code{"glm"}, which estimates the weights using generalized
linear models.}

\item{stabilize}{\code{logical}; whether or not to stabilize the weights.
Stabilizing the weights involves fitting a model predicting treatment at
each time point from treatment status at prior time points. If \code{TRUE}, a
fully saturated model will be fit (i.e., all interactions between all
treatments up to each time point), essentially using the observed treatment
probabilities in the numerator (for binary and multi-category treatments).
This may yield an error if some combinations are not observed. Default is
\code{FALSE}. To manually specify stabilization model formulas, e.g., to specify
non-saturated models, use \code{num.formula}. With many time points, saturated
models may be time-consuming or impossible to fit.}

\item{by}{a string containing the name of the variable in \code{data} for which
weighting is to be done within categories or a one-sided formula with the
stratifying variable on the right-hand side. For example, if \code{by = "gender"} or \code{by = ~gender},
a separate propensity score model or
optimization will occur within each level of the variable \code{"gender"}. Only
one \code{by} variable is allowed; to stratify by multiply variables
simultaneously, create a new variable that is a full cross of those
variables using \code{\link[=interaction]{interaction()}}.}

\item{s.weights}{a vector of sampling weights or the name of a variable in
\code{data} that contains sampling weights. These can also be matching weights
if weighting is to be used on matched data. See the individual pages for
each method for information on whether sampling weights can be supplied.}

\item{num.formula}{optional; a one-sided formula with the stabilization
factors (other than the previous treatments) on the right hand side, which
adds, for each time point, the stabilization factors to a model saturated
with previous treatments. See Cole & Hernán (2008) for a discussion of how
to specify this model; including stabilization factors can change the
estimand without proper adjustment, and should be done with caution. Can
also be a list of one-sided formulas, one for each time point. Unless you
know what you are doing, we recommend setting \code{stabilize = TRUE} and
ignoring \code{num.formula}.}

\item{missing}{\code{character}; how missing data should be handled. The options
and defaults depend on the \code{method} used. Ignored if no missing data is
present. It should be noted that multiple imputation outperforms all
available missingness methods available in \code{weightit()} and should probably
be used instead. Consider the \CRANpkg{MatchThem} package for the use of
\code{weightit()} with multiply imputed data.}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical}; whether to print additional information output by
the fitting function.}

\item{include.obj}{\code{logical}; whether to include in the output a list of the fit objects
created in the process of estimating the weights at each time point. For
example, with \code{method = "glm"}, a list of the \code{glm} objects containing the
propensity score models at each time point will be included. See the help
pages for each method for information on what object will be included if
\code{TRUE}.}

\item{keep.mparts}{\code{logical}; whether to include in the output components
necessary to estimate standard errors that account for estimation of the
weights in \code{\link[=glm_weightit]{glm_weightit()}}. Default is \code{TRUE} if such parts are present.
See the individual pages for each method for whether these components are
produced. Set to \code{FALSE} to keep the output object smaller, e.g., if
standard errors will not be computed using \code{glm_weightit()}.}

\item{is.MSM.method}{\code{logical}; whether the method estimates weights for multiple time
points all at once (\code{TRUE}) or by estimating weights at each time point and
then multiplying them together (\code{FALSE}). This is only relevant for
user-specified functions.}

\item{weightit.force}{\code{logical}; several methods are not valid for estimating weights
with longitudinal treatments, and will produce an error message if
attempted. Set to \code{TRUE} to bypass this error message.}

\item{...}{other arguments for functions called by \code{weightit()} that control
aspects of fitting that are not covered by the above arguments. See Details
at \code{\link[=weightit]{weightit()}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{weightitMSM} object with the following elements:
\item{weights}{The estimated weights, one for each unit.}
\item{treat.list}{A list of the values of the time-varying treatment variables.}
\item{covs.list}{A list of the covariates used in the fitting at each time point. Only includes the raw covariates, which may have been altered in the fitting process.}
\item{data}{The data.frame originally entered to \code{weightitMSM()}.}
\item{estimand}{"ATE", currently the only estimand for MSMs with binary or multi-category treatments.}
\item{method}{The weight estimation method specified.}
\item{ps.list}{A list of the estimated propensity scores (if any) at each time point.}
\item{s.weights}{The provided sampling weights.}
\item{by}{A data.frame containing the \code{by} variable when specified.}
\item{stabilization}{The stabilization factors, if any.}

When \code{keep.mparts} is \code{TRUE} (the default) and the chosen method is
compatible with M-estimation, the components related to M-estimation for use
in \code{\link[=glm_weightit]{glm_weightit()}} are stored in the \code{"Mparts.list"} attribute. When \code{by} is
specified, \code{keep.mparts} is set to \code{FALSE}.
}
\description{
\code{weightitMSM()} allows for the easy generation of balancing
weights for marginal structural models for time-varying treatments using a
variety of available methods for binary, continuous, and multi-category
treatments. Many of these methods exist in other packages, which \code{\link[=weightit]{weightit()}}
calls; these packages must be installed to use the desired method.
}
\details{
Currently only "wide" data sets, where each row corresponds to a
unit's entire variable history, are supported. You can use \code{\link[=reshape]{reshape()}} or
other functions to transform your data into this format; see example below.

In general, \code{weightitMSM()} works by separating the estimation of weights
into separate procedures for each time period based on the formulas provided.
For each formula, \code{weightitMSM()} simply calls \code{weightit()} to that formula,
collects the weights for each time period, and multiplies them together to
arrive at longitudinal balancing weights.

Each formula should contain all the covariates to be balanced on. For
example, the formula corresponding to the second time period should contain
all the baseline covariates, the treatment variable at the first time period,
and the time-varying covariates that took on values after the first treatment
and before the second. Currently, only wide data sets are supported, where
each unit is represented by exactly one row that contains the covariate and
treatment history encoded in separate variables.

The \code{"cbps"} method, which calls \code{CBPS()} in \pkg{CBPS}, will yield different
results from \code{CBMSM()} in \pkg{CBPS} because \code{CBMSM()} takes a different
approach to generating weights than simply estimating several time-specific
models.
