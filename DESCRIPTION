Description: Generates balancing weights for causal effect estimation in observational studies with
             binary, multi-category, or continuous point or longitudinal treatments by easing and
             extending the functionality of several R packages and providing in-house estimation methods.
             Available methods include those that rely on parametric modeling, optimization, and machine learning. Also
             allows for assessment of weights and checking of covariate balance by interfacing directly
             with the 'cobalt' package. Methods for estimating weighted regression models that take into account 
             uncertainty in the estimation of the weights via M-estimation or bootstrapping are available. See the vignette "Installing Supporting Packages" for instructions on how
             to install any package 'WeightIt' uses, including those that may not be on CRAN.
