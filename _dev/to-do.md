## To Do

* Add M-estimation for coxph_weightit() (https://doi.org/10.1002/bimj.201700330)
* Create function for estimating treatment effects to remove marginaleffects as dependency (possibly in a new package)
* Implement imbalance tolerance for entropy balancing and IPT, possibly in a new package
* Implement ReiszBoost for GBM weighting
* Add kernel balancing
* Ensure g-computation SE is correct (unconditional variance)
* Add capabilities for estimating censoring weights (or a guide for hacking them)
