#' Compute effective sample size of weighted sample
#'
#' @description Computes the effective sample size (ESS) of a weighted sample,
#' which represents the size of an unweighted sample with approximately the same
#' amount of precision as the weighted sample under consideration.
#'
#' The ESS is calculated as \eqn{(\sum w)^2/\sum w^2}.
#'
#' @param w a vector of weights
