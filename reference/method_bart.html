Bayesian additive regression trees (BART)-based propensity scores by setting
method = "bart" in the call to weightit() or weightitMSM(). This method
can be used with binary, multi-category, and continuous treatments.
In general, this method relies on estimating propensity scores using BART and
then converting those propensity scores into weights using a formula that
depends on the desired estimand. This method relies on dbarts::bart2()

from the dbarts package.
Binary Treatments


For binary treatments, this method estimates the propensity scores using
dbarts::bart2()
. The following estimands are allowed: ATE, ATT, ATC,
ATO, ATM, and ATOS. Weights can also be computed using marginal mean
weighting through stratification for the ATE, ATT, and ATC. See
get_w_from_ps() for details.



Multi-Category Treatments


For multi-category treatments, the propensity scores are estimated using
several calls to dbarts::bart2()
, one for each treatment group; the
treatment probabilities are not normalized to sum to 1. The following
estimands are allowed: ATE, ATT, ATC, ATO, and ATM. The weights for each
estimand are computed using the standard formulas or those mentioned above.
Weights can also be computed using marginal mean weighting through
stratification for the ATE, ATT, and ATC. See get_w_from_ps() for details.



Continuous Treatments


For continuous treatments, weights are estimated as
\(w_i = f_A(a_i) / f_{A|X}(a_i)\), where \(f_A(a_i)\) (known as the
stabilization factor) is the unconditional density of treatment evaluated the
observed treatment value and \(f_{A|X}(a_i)\) (known as the generalized
propensity score) is the conditional density of treatment given the
covariates evaluated at the observed value of treatment. The shape of
\(f_A(.)\) and \(f_{A|X}(.)\) is controlled by the density argument
described below (normal distributions by default), and the predicted values
used for the mean of the conditional density are estimated using BART as
implemented in dbarts::bart2()
. Kernel density estimation can be used
instead of assuming a specific density for the numerator and denominator by
setting density = "kernel". Other arguments to density() can be specified
to refine the density estimation parameters.



Longitudinal Treatments


For longitudinal treatments, the weights are the product of the weights
estimated at each time point.



Sampling Weights


Sampling weights are not supported.



Missing Data


In the presence of missing data, the following value(s) for missing are
allowed:
"ind" (default)
First, for each variable with missingness, a new missingness indicator variable is created which takes the value 1 if the original covariate is NA and 0 otherwise. The missingness indicators are added to the model formula as main effects. The missing values in the covariates are then replaced with the covariate medians. The weight estimation then proceeds with this new formula and set of covariates. The covariates output in the resulting weightit object will be the original covariates with the NAs.







M-estimation


M-estimation is not supported.

    <h2 id="details">Details<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#details"></a></h2>
    <p>BART works by fitting a sum-of-trees model for the treatment or
probability of treatment. The number of trees is determined by the <code>n.trees</code>
argument. Bayesian priors are used for the hyperparameters, so the result is
a posterior distribution of predicted values for each unit. The mean of these
for each unit is taken for use in computing the (generalized) propensity
score. Although the hyperparameters governing the priors can be modified by
supplying arguments to <code><a href="weightit.html">weightit()</a></code> that are passed to the BART fitting
function, the default values tend to work well and require little
modification (though the defaults differ for continuous and categorical
treatments; see the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/dbarts/man/bart.html" class="external-link">dbarts::bart2()</a></code>
 documentation for details). Unlike
many other machine learning methods, no loss function is optimized and the
hyperparameters do not need to be tuned (e.g., using cross-validation),
though performance can benefit from tuning. BART tends to balance sparseness
with flexibility by using very weak learners as the trees, which makes it
suitable for capturing complex functions without specifying a particular
functional form and without overfitting.</p><div class="section">
<h3 id="reproducibility">Reproducibility<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#reproducibility"></a></h3>


<p>BART has a random component, so some work must be done to ensure
reproducibility across runs. See the <em>Reproducibility</em> section at
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/dbarts/man/bart.html" class="external-link">dbarts::bart2()</a></code>
 for more details. To ensure reproducibility, one can
do one of two things:</p><ol><li><p>supply an argument to <code>seed</code>, which is passed to <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/dbarts/man/bart.html" class="external-link">dbarts::bart2()</a></code> and sets the seed for single- and multi-threaded uses, or</p></li>
<li><p>call <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html" class="external-link">set.seed()</a></code> and set <code>n.threads = 1</code> to use single-threading.
Note that to ensure reproducibility on any machine, regardless of the number of
cores available, one should use single-threading by setting <code>n.threads = 1</code> and either supply <code>seed</code> or
call <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html" class="external-link">set.seed()</a></code>.</p></li>
</ol></div>

    </div>
    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="additional-arguments">Additional Arguments<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#additional-arguments"></a></h2>



<p>All arguments to <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/dbarts/man/bart.html" class="external-link">dbarts::bart2()</a></code>
 can be passed through <code><a href="weightit.html">weightit()</a></code>
or <code><a href="weightitMSM.html">weightitMSM()</a></code>, with the following exceptions:</p><ul><li><p><code>test</code>, <code>weights</code>,<code>subset</code>, <code>offset.test</code> are ignored</p></li>
<li><p><code>combine.chains</code> is always set to <code>TRUE</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>sampleronly</code> is always set to <code>FALSE</code></p></li>
</ul><p>For binary and multi-category treatments, the following arguments may be supplied:</p><dl><dt><code>subclass</code></dt>
<dd><p><code>integer</code>; the number of subclasses to use for computing
weights using marginal mean weighting through stratification (MMWS). If <code>NULL</code>,
standard inverse probability weights (and their extensions) will be
computed; if a number greater than 1, subclasses will be formed and weights
will be computed based on subclass membership. See <code><a href="get_w_from_ps.html">get_w_from_ps()</a></code> for
details and references.</p></dd>


</dl><p>For continuous treatments, the following arguments may be supplied:</p><dl><dt><code>density</code></dt>
<dd><p>A function corresponding to the conditional density of the treatment. The standardized residuals of the treatment model will be fed through this function to produce the numerator and denominator of the generalized propensity score weights. If blank, <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Normal.html" class="external-link">dnorm()</a></code> is used as recommended by Robins et al. (2000). This can also be supplied as a string containing the name of the function to be called. If the string contains underscores, the call will be split by the underscores and the latter splits will be supplied as arguments to the second argument and beyond. For example, if <code>density = "dt_2"</code> is specified, the density used will be that of a t-distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. Using a t-distribution can be useful when extreme outcome values are observed (Naimi et al., 2014).</p>
<p>Can also be <code>"kernel"</code> to use kernel density estimation, which calls <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/density.html" class="external-link">density()</a></code> to estimate the numerator and denominator densities for the weights. (This used to be requested by setting <code>use.kernel = TRUE</code>, which is now deprecated.)</p></dd>

<dd><p>If <code>density = "kernel"</code>, the arguments to <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/density.html" class="external-link">density()</a></code>.
