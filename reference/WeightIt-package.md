# WeightIt: Weighting for Covariate Balance in Observational Studies

Generates balancing weights for causal effect estimation in
observational studies with binary, multi-category, or continuous point
or longitudinal treatments by easing and extending the functionality of
several R packages and providing in-house estimation methods. Available
methods include those that rely on parametric modeling, optimization,
and machine learning. Also allows for assessment of weights and checking
of covariate balance by interfacing directly with the 'cobalt' package.
Methods for estimating weighted regression models that take into account
uncertainty in the estimation of the weights via M-estimation or
bootstrapping are available. See the vignette "Installing Supporting
Packages" for instructions on how to install any package 'WeightIt'
uses, including those that may not be on CRAN.
